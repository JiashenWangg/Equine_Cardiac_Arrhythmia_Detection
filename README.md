# Equine_Cardiac_Arrhythmia_Detection

Cardiac arrhythmias in horses are serious conditions
that are potentially life-threatening. Our research focuses
on analyzing horse ECG data to understand arrhythmia
patterns comprehensively. By employing advanced
statistical methods on ECG data, we aim to enhance the
detection of horse cardiac arrhythmia. Methods include 
hierarchical clustering, Chi-Squared tests, and functional PCA.
